# Heart-Disease-Detection-Using-ML
Heart disease is a leading cause of mortality worldwide, and early detection is crucial in reducing death rates. Machine learning (ML) techniques have shown significant promise in accurately predicting the risk of heart disease by analyzing various patient data. Logistic regression, decision trees, support vector machines, and deep learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks are among the ML models used in heart disease detection.

However, developing accurate ML models for heart disease detection faces several challenges. One such challenge is related to data quality, where the quality of input data determines the accuracy of the model. Imbalanced datasets, where one class has significantly more samples than the other, can also lead to inaccurate predictions. Model interpretability is also vital in developing accurate ML models.
